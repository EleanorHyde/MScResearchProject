## Action video gamers' task switching and processing speed abilities: a mixed method investigation.
Conducted by Eleanor Hyde at the University of Sheffield. Supervised by Dr Claudia von Bastain.

## Research Aims
Action video games, and especially the sub-genre First Person Shooter (FPS) games, contribute 47.8% of total video
game sales (Entertainment Software Association, 2019). Recently, researchers have explored whether playing action
video games can have a positive impact on several cognitive domains such as executive function. Executive functions
are an umbrella term for cognitive processes which enable people to regulate their thoughts and actions during goaldirected behavior (Friedman & Miyake, 2012). Evidence from prior studies suggests that FPS gamers perform better in
tasks measuring executive functions, particularly in the ability to switch attentional focus between different concurrent
tasks (Green, Sugarman, Medford, Klobusicky & Bavelier, 2012). However, it is yet unclear to what extent these
differences are due to better executive processing or are due to faster processing speed abilities (van Ravenzwaaij,
Boekel, Forstmann, Ratcliff & Wagenmakers, 2014).

The aim of this study is to further explore the cognitive abilities of FPS players by examining task-switching and
processing speed abilities in individuals who play the FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). Previous
research has compared individuals with no video game experience to those who have played various games for a
minimal amount of time (e.g. 1 hour per day over the past 6 months; Green & Bavelier, 2003). However, different games
and different levels of expertise in video gaming may be associated differently with cognitive abilities. Therefore, we aim
to use a large sample of casual, experienced and professional FPS gamers, playing a specific game (CS:GO), to evaluate
the task switching and processing speed abilities in this group of highly trained individuals. Some of these gamers will
likely have hours well exceeding the expertise level of gamers in previous studies. Furthermore, the qualitative data
collected from casual, expert and professional gamers is novel to the field of research; it will add to the wider researcher
knowledge of gaming expertise improving future study

## Methods
The study consists of two distinct parts: a pilot semi-structured interview, followed by the experiment. We aim to recruit
3 participants for the pilot (one casual, one expert and one professional CS:GO player) and, for the experiment, a much
wider sample of CS:GO players, varying in their levels of gaming expertise.

### Semi-Structured Interview (30-60 mins)
The aim of the interview is to explore participants’ personal views and experiences with CS:GO and to optimize the
design and phrasing of questions in the game-specific expertise questionnaire in the later experiment.
Participants will be recruited by convenience sampling through personal contacts of the primary researcher. They will be
individually invited via email to a Google Meet interview and a time arranged for the interview, at their convenience.
Additionally, they will be sent the participant information sheet, consent form and a short Google Form survey to gather
demographic and computer specification information (e.g. Graphics Card and Processor). The latter information is
gathered as a potential proxy for expertise, with more expert players possibly using technologies with higher
specifications.

Prior to the interview, the participant will give written consent for the interview to be recorded, which the researcher will
verbally confirm at the beginning of the interview. After a few general warm-up questions, the topics covered in the
interview will include player statistics, playstyle, their views on how to define gaming expertise, and the roles of
tournaments, performance aids, required skills and professional gaming. The specific questions are outlined in the
attached interview questions sheet. If additional information or explanation is required, the researcher will ask further
questions, before returning to the next item to be discussed. The researcher will ensure that the interview moves
smoothly and finishes after approximately 60 minutes. Once completed, the researcher will thank the participant for
their time and ensure they are aware that if they have any further questions that they are free to ask them.

### Experiment (30 mins)
Participants will be provided with a link to the Qualtrics Survey, the first section of which provides participants with the
Information Sheet and Consent form. Participants will be asked to click a button to confirm that they have read and
understood the information, and are willing to take part in the research. Participants must respond with “Yes” for
continuation of the experiment. Those who respond with “No” will be thanked for their time and the rest of the
experiment will not continue.
Following this, the Qualtrics Survey will link participants to the Tatool Web Task (Shape-Color Switching, see URL below)
which will measure processing speed and task switching. This task has been extensively used in previous research,
including in research conducted by the supervisor (e.g., von Bastian et al., 2016 ). Once completed, the final slide of the
task will show participants their unique completion code, which they will copy-paste into the Qualtrics Survey. Afterward,
a short questionnaire will continue on Qualtrics.The items on this questionnaire will be guided and influenced by the
initial semi-structured interview questions and will likely have many similar questions but in a shorter and closed-answer
format. All questions will include the options “I don’t know” and “I prefer not to say”. The main focus of this
questionnaire is to gather demographics, information regarding the player’s individual CS:GO expertise level and
experience playing action video games. We expect this questionnaire will take 5-10 minutes to complete and the task
15-20 minutes. Once completed, participants will be provided with the Debrief Sheet via Qualtrics, and will be
encouraged to contact the researcher with any further questions.

## Participants
We aim to recruit 3 participants for the interview, consisting of self-identifying casual, expert or professional CS:GO
players. For the experiment, we aim to recruit a larger sample of 300 participants who will be CS:GO players of any
experience. We determined this sample size based on simulations showing that correlations of the size typically found in
psychological research stabilize at *N* = 250 (Schönbrodt & Perugini, 2013), with an additional N = 50 to account for
incomplete data sets.

### Participant Criteria
We aim for the participants to represent our target population of CS:GO players. All participants must meet the following
inclusion criteria:
* 16-35 years old
* Proficient English for understanding the instructions and questions
* Play CS:GO, with any frequency or experience
* Have access to a computer with internet connection.

Additionally, those participating in the interview will need to have a computer with access to Google Meet, a webcam and
a microphone.

Participants who will complete the experiment will additionally meet the following inclusion criteria:
* Normal or corrected-to-normal vision, including no color blindness
* No current diagnosis of neurological, psychological or psychiatric illness
* No current medication with know side-effects on cognition
* No current recreational drug use (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, or methamphetamine)

### Recruiting Participants
Interview participants have been selected via the researcher’s personal contacts and word-of-mouth. The wider sample
of participants will be recruited using a range of methods to ensure a large reach including opportunity and ‘snowball’
sampling. The main methods of recruitment will be via social media, posts on community boards (e.g. Steam) and email.

## Payment
As outlined above, a large sample of at least N = 300 is required to conduct the relevant analyses. To facilitate
recruitment, we will compensate the first 300 participants with £4 Amazon vouchers upon completion following
verification of the completion through unique experiment tokens provided by the experiment software. In addition, all
participants (including any completing the study after the first 300 participants) will enter a prize draw for 1x £100, 1x
£50, and 5x £10 prizes. Furthermore, the 3 individuals who participate in the interview will be compensated with a £7
Amazon voucher. This compensation scheme and the spending have been approved by the Department of Psychology.

## Potential Risks
The study is not expected to cause physical or psychological harm or distress to participants greater than that
experienced in daily life, or from a similar discussion with friends. However, some potential risks have been identified:
1. Participants may find the interview questions to be challenging or probling, potential psychological distress may occur.
2. If participants find the cognitive task particularly challenging, potential psychological distress may occur.
How will this be managed to ensure appropriate protection and well-being of the participants?

The potential sources of risk presented above will be managed as follows:
1. Participants will be informed in the participant information sheet and consent form that if they wish to stop the
interview at any point or skip answering a question then they are free to do so without any negative impact or question.
If they are not comfortable providing researchers with information about their PC specification they will be reassured
that this information cannot be used to harm or access their PC in any manner. Additionally, they will be informed in the
participant information sheet and consent form that all data will not be linked to them personally.
2. The information sheet and consent form will remind participants that if they wish to withdraw or stop the task at any
point, they are free to do so by closing their browser. The debrief sheet will have information about accessing support
services and a reminder of the purpose and aims of the study if the task raised any concerns around their health.

## Data Confidentiality
Post-interview and experimental tasks, participants will be assigned an anonymous participant code for analysis and
publishing. The interviews will be video and audio recorded and transcribed for analysis. Once transcription is concluded,
the original recordings will be deleted to maintain participant confidentiality. Transcripts of the interviews will be
anonymised and saved using only the anonymised participant codes. Participants will be advised that if they wish to
withdraw, they must do so no later than two weeks after the interview, and that they will not be able to withdraw their
data later as data will be anonymised ready for analysis after this point. In the experiment, data will be anonymised as
soon as participants begin the study. Participants will be advised that if they wish to withdraw they must do so whilst in
the study, and that they will not be able to withdraw their data once they have completed the experiment.
